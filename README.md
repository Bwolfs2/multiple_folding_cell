### The Flutter Vignettes

This vignette is part of a collection of explorations into the exciting user experience possibilities enabled by the Flutter platform. Built by [gskinner](https://gskinner.com) in partnership with Google, these vignettes range from practical to novel. They aim to inspire both developers and designers to build delightful and beautiful experiences with Flutter. You can view all of the vignettes in the main [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/flutter_vignettes). 

In addition to reviewing and forking the [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md) code available here, you can also check out more information on the [Vignette Showcase Website](https://flutter.gskinner.com).
